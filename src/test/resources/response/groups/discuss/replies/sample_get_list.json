Method requires read privileges; none granted.\r\n\r\nwhen attempting to download photos. I have set \r\n\r\nauthInterface.getAuthorizationUrl(rtoken, Permission.DELETE);\r\n\r\n(I need access to delete photos as well as download them) which I assumed also allows read and write access, as well as delete.\r\n\r\nShould I instead by ORing all Permissions I need together?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!"
