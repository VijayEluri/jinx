This is basically like the check against &quot;parameterless searches&quot; for queries without a geo component. \r\n\r\nA tag, for instance, is considered a limiting agent as are user defined min_date_taken and min_date_upload parameters — If no limiting factor is passed we return only photos added in the last 12 hours (though we may extend the limit in the future).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/services\/api\/flickr.photos.search.html\">www.flickr.com\/services\/api\/flickr.photos.search.html<\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\nMy bboxes are very small which should prevent the database from crying.

However, that will be a looot of request.\r\nI am not good with math but I think that might be 1Mio requests, done one after another. \r\n\r\nWill the REST API allow that or do I have to set a timer to get the information (only 1 request per second or something like that).\r\n\r\nThanks for your answeres.\r\nChris"
