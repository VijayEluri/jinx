Jinx - Flickr API for Java

Jinx is a Java interface to the Flickr API. The project goals are:

1) Simple to use
2) Pure java with no other dependencies
3) Complete coverage of the Flickr API

CURRENT STATUS
==============
This project is currently in development phase. You can download, build, and use it, but don't cry when it breaks.

Error handling should probably be improved, and argument checking needs to be done.

This list shows which API entry points have been implemented:
  * activity
  * auth
  * blogs
  * collections
  * commons
  * contacts
  * favorites
  * galleries
  * groups
  * groups.members
  * groups.pools
  * interestingness
  * machinetags (partial)
  * panda
  * photos
  * photosets



BUILDING
========
There are project files here for NetBeans, but NetBeans is not required. To build the project, execute ant jar. The compiled jar file will be in dist/.

TODO:

Implement these API entry points:
people
photos.comments
photos.geo
photos.licenses
photos.notes
photos.people
photos.transform
photos.upload
photosets.comments
places
prefs
reflection
stats
tags
test
urls


DEVELOPERS READ THIS
====================
Flickr apps need an API key to work properly. Jinx is no exception. To run
the unit tests, you need to go to Flickr and apply for an API key. Once you have
this key, copy the test/flickr.properties file to test/net/jeremybrooks/jinx/secret.properties
and fill in the key and secret. This file is excluded by the .gitignore file,
so your secrets will not end up on github.

When you create a unit test, your setUpClass method should look like this:

@BeforeClass
public static void setUpClass() throws Exception {
    Setup.doSetup();
}

This will ensure that Jinx is set up with you key, secret, and token, and the
unit tests can be executed.
