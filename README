Jinx - Flickr API for Java

Jinx is a Java interface to the Flickr API. The project goals are:

1) Simple to use
2) Pure java with no other dependencies
3) Complete coverage of the Flickr API

CURRENT STATUS
==============
This project is currently in development phase. You can download, build, and use it, but don't cry when it breaks.

The Auth and Photos API's have been implemented. There are some errors when calling a couple of the Photos methods, but overall it works now. The test class has not been implemented.

Error handling should probably be improved, and argument checking needs to be done.

June 21, 2010:
The AuthApi, PhotosApi, and PhotosetsApi should be pretty stable now. Each method call
has been tested and verified working.

BUILDING
========
There are project files here for NetBeans, but NetBeans is not required. To build the project, execute ant jar. The compiled jar file will be in dist/.
