Jinx - Flickr API for Java

Jinx is a Java interface to the Flickr API. The project goals are:

1) Simple to use
2) Pure java with no other dependencies
3) Complete coverage of the Flickr API

CURRENT STATUS
==============
This project is currently in development phase. You can download, build, and use it, but don't cry when it breaks.

Error handling should probably be improved, and argument checking needs to be done.

June 21, 2010:
The AuthApi, PhotosApi, and PhotosetsApi should be pretty stable now. Each method call
has been tested and verified working.

August 31, 2010:
The ActivityApi is working.
Added support for Medium 640 size.
Added support for flickr.blogs.* via BlogsApi class.


BUILDING
========
There are project files here for NetBeans, but NetBeans is not required. To build the project, execute ant jar. The compiled jar file will be in dist/.

TODO:
Add photo_z info to Photos class, and populate it from PhotosApi.
