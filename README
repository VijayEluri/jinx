Jinx - Flickr API for Java

Jinx is a Java interface to the Flickr API. The project goals are:

1) Simple to use
2) Pure java with no other dependencies
3) Complete coverage of the Flickr API

CURRENT STATUS
==============
This project is currently in development phase. You can download, build, and use it, but don't cry when it breaks.

Error handling should probably be improved, and argument checking needs to be done.

This list shows which API entry points have been implemented:
  * activity
  * auth
  * blogs
  * collections
  * commons
  * contacts
  * favorites
  * galleries
  * groups
  * groups.members
  * groups.pools
  * interestingness
  * machinetags (partial)
  * photos
  * photosets



BUILDING
========
There are project files here for NetBeans, but NetBeans is not required. To build the project, execute ant jar. The compiled jar file will be in dist/.
