Jinx - Flickr API for Java

Jinx is a Java interface to the Flickr API. The project goals are:

1) Simple to use
2) Pure java with no other dependencies
3) Complete coverage of the Flickr API

CURRENT STATUS
==============
The API is being implemented a section at a time. The parts that are implemented should be stable enough for production use. This library is used by SuprSetr, which is making thousands of calls to the API every day.

This list shows which API entry points have been implemented:
  * activity
  * auth
  * blogs
  * collections
  * commons
  * contacts
  * favorites
  * galleries
  * groups
  * groups.members
  * groups.pools
  * interestingness
  * machinetags (partial)
  * panda
  * people
  * photos
  * photos.comments
  * photosets



BUILDING
========
There are project files here for NetBeans, but NetBeans is not required. To build the project, execute ant jar. The compiled jar file will be in dist/.

TODO:

Implement these API entry points:
photos.geo
photos.licenses
photos.notes
photos.people
photos.transform
photos.upload
photosets.comments
places
prefs
reflection
stats
tags
test
urls


DEVELOPERS READ THIS
====================
Flickr apps need an API key to work properly. Jinx is no exception. To run
the unit tests, you need to go to Flickr and apply for an API key. Once you have
this key, copy the test/flickr.properties file to test/net/jeremybrooks/jinx/secret.properties
and fill in the key and secret. This file is excluded by the .gitignore file,
so your secrets will not end up on github.

When you create a unit test, your setUpClass method should look like this:

@BeforeClass
public static void setUpClass() throws Exception {
    Setup.doSetup();
}

This will ensure that Jinx is set up with you key, secret, and token, and the
unit tests can be executed.
