        <h1>About Interlacer</h1>
        <hr/>
        
        <p>Interlacer combines multiple images and colors into a single image by interlacing them together. The final image consists of a line from each image/color in succession, like this:</p>
        
        <img src="example.png"/>
        
        <h2>Using Interlacer</h2>
        <p>Tap the <img src="13-plus-light.png"/> button to add images or colors. You can add images from the camera or from your photo albums. As you add images and colors, the interlaced image will be processed and displayed in the preview area.</p>
        
        <p>The size of the interlaced image will be the smallest width/height of all the images that you have selected. If you select only color swatches, the size of the interlaced image will be the screen resolution of your device.</p>
        
        <p>The preview image is a scaled down version of the full size image. To see the image at full resolution, save it and look at it in the Photos App.</p>
        
        <p>Tap <img src="disk.png"/> to save the image. If you want to start over, tap <img src="11-x-light.png"/> to clear your selections. This will clear all the image and color selections and the preview area, but will not reset the interlace setting sliders.</p>
        
        <p>Tap on any image or color swatch to reveal the image detail view. If the selection is        an image, you will see the size of the image. If the selection is a color, you will see        the RGB values for the color. You can also remove the image/color by tapping the <img src="11-x-light.png"/> button on the image detail view.</p>
        
        <h2>Interlace Settings</h2>        
        <p>Tap the <img src="106-sliders-light.png"/> button to adjust the interlace        settings. By default, one line from each image/color is used at a time. You can make the processed image look chunkier by adjusting the line size. Sliding the line size all the way to the right will enable random mode, where the line size will vary randomly.</p>
        <p>Adjusting the shift setting will cause every other line in the image to be shifted a certain number of pixels. Try selecting only one image and adjust the shift to get an idea of what it does.</p>
        
        <p>Tap <img src="02-redo-light.png"/> to reset the sliders to their default values.</p>
        
        
        <h2>App Settings</h2>
        <p>You can change application settings by using the Settings App, or by tapping the <img src="gear.png"/> icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Available application settings are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Photo Overlay</b>: If Photo Overlay is turned on, the first selected image will be overlaid on the camera view. This can assist with lining up multiple images.</li>
            <li><b>Save Camera Photos</b>: If Save Camera Photos is turned on, images you take with the camera will automatically be saved.</li>
            <li><b>Autosave Results</b>: If Autosave Results is turned on, each interlaced image will be saved as it is created. Be careful with this one. You may end up saving more images than you realize!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p><b>Why did it crash?</b> It crashed because you found a bug. :-) Efforts have been made to protect against many conditions that could cause a crash. However, it is nearly impossible to test every scenario. If you do experience a crash, please sync your device with iTunes. The crash report will be submitted to the App Store, where the developer can view it and use it to improve the application.</p>
        
        <p><b>Why doesn't it do x, y, and z?</b> Send the developer an email with your feature request. If enough people ask for a feature, chances are it will get implemented in a future update!</p>
        
        <p><b>How many images can I use at once?</b> The number of images you can process is limited by the amount of memory that is free for the application to use and the size of the images you are trying to interlace. During testing, dozens of images were successfully interlaced.</p>
        
        <p><b>Is there a Flickr group for the app?</b> Yes, there is! Feel free to submit any images you create with Interlacer to the Interlacer App Flickr group, located at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/interlacerapp/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/interlacerapp/</a>.
